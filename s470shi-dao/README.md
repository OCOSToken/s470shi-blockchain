# S470SHI DAO — The 47,000 S47 Legacy

> “A true chain is not built by code or coins, but by the collective trust and vision of its community.”
>  
> — S470SHI Genesis

---

## Overview

**S470SHI DAO** is the world’s first and only decentralized autonomous organization built on the philosophy of collective legacy.  
47,000 S47 wallets — each a symbolic echo of the origin — are inherited by the DAO itself, governed only by the voice and will of its participants.

**Our mission:** To build the most transparent, secure, and community-governed blockchain protocol, where every decision is made by those who hold the legacy.

---

## Core Philosophy

- **No single founder, no hidden hand:** All references to origin or creator are abstracted as “S470SHI”.
- **Community is the code:** Every S47 token and wallet is a voice in the DAO.
- **Legacy by design:** 47,000 S47 wallets are inherited by the DAO treasury at genesis and controlled through transparent on-chain governance.
- **Maximum transparency:** All votes, transactions, and governance actions are fully on-chain, auditable, and open-source.
- **Eternal governance:** The DAO cannot die; legacy wallets and the protocol itself are maintained and upgraded only by supermajority community vote.

---

## Key Features

- **47,000 S47 Legacy Wallets:**  
  Symbolically mirroring the mythos of decentralized origin, 47,000 unique wallets and their S47 tokens are permanently held by the DAO treasury.
- **DAO Governance Token (S47):**  
  The S47 token grants on-chain voting, proposal, and legacy rights.
- **On-Chain Voting:**  
  All proposals, upgrades, treasury uses, and legacy actions require DAO-wide voting with clear quorum and supermajority thresholds.
- **DAO Treasury Controls:**  
  The legacy treasury can only be used or moved with at least 75% community supermajority approval.
- **Open Audit & Security:**  
  All contracts are open-source and undergo external and community audit (CertiK ✅).
- **Legacy Monitoring:**  
  Complete transparency and annual on-chain reporting for all legacy wallets and treasury movements.

## Governance and Legacy

- **Proposals:**  
  Any S47 holder can submit a proposal for DAO upgrades, treasury usage, or legacy transfers.
- **Quorum & Majority:**  
  Minimum quorum is 4,700 votes (10% of total); supermajority (75%) required for treasury/legacy actions.
- **On-chain audit:**  
  All actions are recorded, auditable, and viewable via explorer or API.
- **Legacy audits:**  
  Annual on-chain reports on legacy wallets and treasury.

---

## Security

- **Responsible disclosure:** See [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).
- **Audits:** All contracts are open-source, audit-friendly, and recommended for third-party review (e.g., CertiK).
- **No keys or secrets in code:** Never commit sensitive info; see [.gitignore](./.gitignore).

---

## Contribution

- **Pull requests** are welcome!  
  Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- **DAO first:** All protocol changes require community proposal and vote.
- **Localization:** Translations and local governance modules encouraged.

## Legacy Hall

Each participant in S470SHI DAO is a holder of the digital legacy —  
not just a token holder, but a symbolic inheritor of the chain’s original vision.

**LEGACY_WALLETS.json** contains the encrypted or public list of all 47,000 S47 legacy wallets.  
DAO supermajority is required to move or reassign any of these wallets’ funds.
