[2025-07-13T18:01:15Z] Step: Dependency Install & Linting
- All environments: PASSED
- Lint warnings: 0
- Security scan (npm, pip, docker): No vulnerabilities detected

[2025-07-13T18:02:40Z] Step: Unit Tests
- Python: 25/25 tests PASSED (100%)
- Node.js: 14/14 tests PASSED (100%)
- Multi-currency parser: 100% coverage

[2025-07-13T18:04:00Z] Step: Integration & Explorer API Tests
- BTC monitor_btc.js: 24/24 PASSED (testnet + regtest)
- Log replay: PASSED (audit logs SHA256 hash matched previous baseline)
- UI explorer: 7/7 currencies rendered in all languages (EN, AZ, RU, CN, ES)

[2025-07-13T18:05:30Z] Step: Scalability Stress Test (simulated 10,000 addresses)
- System load: OK (CPU: 68%, RAM: 54%)
- Average API response time: 0.88s
- No rate limit triggers, no API errors

[2025-07-13T18:07:12Z] Step: Security & Attack Scenarios
- Fake payment: Blocked
- Double spend: Blocked
- Log poisoning: Detected & filtered
- DDoS/API failover: Recovered in 2 retries

---------------------------------------------------------------
[2025-07-13T18:08:44Z] Step: Multi-Node Deploy Integration

- Docker Swarm deploy: 3 node (EU, US, Asia)
- All containers healthy, explorer API HA (high-availability) passed
- BTC node, explorer, backend, frontend and DB fully integrated

[2025-07-13T18:10:10Z] Step: End-to-End User Acceptance Test (UAT)
- Simulated user payment via BIP-21 QR: PASSED
- Explorer UI: Payments confirmed and status updated in <3s for all nodes
- Multi-currency payments correctly processed (BTC, LTC, ETH testnets)

[2025-07-13T18:11:00Z] Step: Regression
- Previous 7 log files replayed, status and DAO state match
- All governance and emergency override features tested

[2025-07-13T18:12:30Z] Step: Deploy Artifacts, Log Archive & Notification
- All logs, config, explorer snapshots and deploy manifests stored: artifacts/cicd-matrix-20250713.zip
- Community notification sent (Telegram, Slack, Discord, Github)
- Build badge: [PASSED]

---------------------------------------------------------------
Summary Matrix:
- Environments: 12 (all PASSED)
- Unit/Integration/Regression: 100% PASS
- Deploy: Multi-node, multi-chain, multi-currency (all nodes healthy)
- Security, scalability, and auditability: VERIFIED
