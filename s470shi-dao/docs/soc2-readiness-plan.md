# OCOS DAO â€” SOC 2 Readiness Plan

---

## 1. Overview

This SOC 2 Readiness Plan prepares OCOS DAO for a formal SOC 2 (Type I/II) audit, based on the AICPA Trust Services Criteria for Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, and Privacy.  
The plan is adapted for decentralized, open-source, and Web3/DAO organizations.

## 4. Policies & Documentation (links)

- **Security Policy:** SECURITY.md
- **Compliance Policy:** docs/compliance.md
- **Incident Response Plan:** logs/manual-dao-emergency-test.log
- **Access Management:** Github repo 2FA, role-based permissions
- **Vendor Management:** Only open-source, reviewed dependencies

---

## 5. Control Implementation Steps

1. **Document all policies**  
   All above policies must be in the repo and reviewed by governance and lead devs.

2. **CI/CD controls**  
   - Every commit triggers full pipeline (see .github/workflows/dao-cicd-matrix.yaml)
   - All tests, audit logs and code coverage stored as artifacts.

3. **Access controls**  
   - 2FA enforced for all with write access.
   - PR review required for every merge to main.

4. **Change management & audit log**  
   - All deploy, monitor, and backend changes logged and timestamped.
   - Monthly and quarterly audit/retention schedule in logs/.

5. **Incident response simulation**  
   - Emergency DAO status change, rollback and notification processes tested (see logs/manual-dao-emergency-test.log).

6. **Backup & disaster recovery**  
   - Node and data snapshots automated.
   - Restore tested quarterly.

7. **Continuous internal review**  
   - Rotating audit by community or external reviewer every quarter.
   - All logs hashed (SHA256) and integrity-checked.
