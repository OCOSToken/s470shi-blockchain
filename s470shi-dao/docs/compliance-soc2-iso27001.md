# OCOS DAO — SOC 2 & ISO 27001 Audit Plan and Compliance Checklist

---

## 1. Overview

This document details the OCOS DAO project’s audit plan and controls, mapped to **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria** and **ISO 27001 Information Security Management System (ISMS)** requirements.  
The plan is designed for both internal and external auditors, legal, or enterprise partners.

## 2. SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria Mapping

### A. **Security**

- **Access Controls:**  
  - GitHub repo: 2FA enforced, restricted write access, PR review required  
  - Server/node: SSH key-based access, role separation (dev, ops, audit)
- **Change Management:**  
  - All code changes require PR, review, and CI/CD pipeline pass before merge  
  - All deploys, governance contract upgrades, and config changes are logged (logs/cicd-pipeline-matrix-deploy.log)
- **Vulnerability Management:**  
  - npm audit, pip-audit, docker scan as CI/CD steps  
  - Monitor scripts tested for negative and attack scenarios (logs/security-attack-scenario-test.log)
- **Incident Response:**  
  - Security incidents documented in audit logs; emergency/rollback via governance vote (logs/manual-dao-emergency-test.log)

### B. **Availability**

- **System Monitoring:**  
  - Uptime and health checks on all public endpoints (API, explorer, backend, node)
- **Backup & Recovery:**  
  - Node/data snapshot scripts and periodic log archive (see docs/ and logs/)
- **Failover:**  
  - Multi-node deploy and automatic monitor recovery (logs/network-failure-recovery.log)

### C. **Processing Integrity**

- **Transaction Logs:**  
  - All payments, TXIDs, and status changes are logged, hashed, and timestamped  
  - Log integrity verified via SHA256 hash (logs/audit-transparency-test.log)
- **Regression Testing:**  
  - CI/CD regression on every push; log replay for payment/audit consistency (logs/ci-cd-regression-test.log)

### D. **Confidentiality**

- **Secrets Management:**  
  - No private key, mnemonic, or sensitive data stored in code or repo  
  - .env, secrets, API keys managed via CI/CD vaults (never hardcoded)
- **User Data:**  
  - No PII collected; only public blockchain data processed

### E. **Privacy**

- **GDPR-aligned:**  
  - No PII processed; user feedback and UI prefs only local/session  
  - Data removal request process via admin@ocos.io

## 3. ISO 27001 Controls & Policies Mapping

### A. **ISMS Scope & Context**

- DAO project, monitor scripts, explorer, all deployed nodes and multi-sig addresses

### B. **Annex A Controls**

- **A.5 Information Security Policies:**  
  - Open-source security policy in SECURITY.md, compliance in compliance.md
- **A.6 Organization of Information Security:**  
  - DAO governance defines roles, multi-sig for treasury, PR/merge approval for codebase
- **A.7 HR Security:**  
  - Contributor access reviewed by DAO multi-sig and PR review
- **A.8 Asset Management:**  
  - Node/data, log files, and audit snapshots tracked and reviewed
- **A.9 Access Control:**  
  - GitHub/Node access logs, 2FA, secrets vaults, reviewer permissions
- **A.10 Cryptography:**  
  - All transactions (BTC, ETH, LTC) use on-chain cryptographic standards; private key ops are offline only
- **A.11 Physical Security:**  
  - No physical infrastructure; cloud-only, node snapshots and backup policy
- **A.12 Operations Security:**  
  - Logs, scripts, pipelines, node monitoring, incident logs
- **A.13 Communications Security:**  
  - All API/server communication over HTTPS; secrets in .env, vault only
- **A.14 System Acquisition, Development, and Maintenance:**  
  - All changes peer-reviewed; CI/CD required; testnet/mainnet separation
- **A.15 Supplier Relationships:**  
  - All dependencies open-source, scanned for vulnerabilities (npm, pip, Docker Hub)
- **A.16 Incident Management:**  
  - Security and emergency incidents logged and communicated to the community (logs/manual-dao-emergency-test.log)
- **A.17 Information Security Aspects of Business Continuity:**  
  - Node snapshot, backup, regular audit and log archive policy
- **A.18 Compliance:**  
  - All licenses open (MIT), logs retained 3 years, full transparency

---

## 4. Audit Plan & Frequency

- **Continuous monitoring:** Logs, payments, node health, and events (every 10 min)
- **Monthly audit:** Review of all logs, incidents, and codebase (rotating DAO audit team)
- **Quarterly regression test:** CI/CD regression logs and governance replay
- **Annual compliance review:** External review by third-party auditor (ISO/SOC 2 partner)

---

## 5. Evidence & Documentation

- **Logs:** logs/* (monitor, payments, audit, attack, emergency, test matrix, etc.)
- **Artifacts:** artifacts/ (CI/CD, coverage, log snapshots, deploy manifests)
- **Configs:** config/* (signers, dao.json, environment matrix)
- **Policies:** SECURITY.md, compliance.md, code_of_conduct.md
- **Pipeline YAML:** .github/workflows/dao-cicd-matrix.yaml
