## Who is Satoshi Nakamoto?

In 2008, a person or group known as “Satoshi Nakamoto” published the foundational paper for the cryptocurrency **Bitcoin**, titled “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System”.  
In January 2009, Nakamoto registered the domain bitcoin.org, released version **0.1 of the software**, and on **January 9, 2009**, mined the first block — the **genesis block**.

### Identity

- Still unknown — remains anonymous.
- In late 2024, a London court ruled that **Craig Wright is not Nakamoto**.
- Speculations resurfaced in 2025:
  - **Jack Dorsey** (founder of Twitter)
  - HBO documentary hinted at **Peter Todd**
  - AI-generated gold bar claims raised suspicions

### Why remain anonymous?

- To preserve Bitcoin’s decentralized nature  
- To avoid legal prosecution  
- To shift focus from the person to the idea

## Bitcoin Technology and Architecture

### Technical Foundations

- **Blockchain**: immutable, transparent chain of transactions
- **Proof of Work (PoW)**: miners compete using SHA-256 to add new blocks
- **Limited Supply**: capped at **21 million BTC**
- **Halving**: rewards halve every 210,000 blocks

| Halving | Date       | Block Reward (BTC) |
|---------|------------|--------------------|
| 1st     | 2012       | 50 → 25            |
| 2nd     | 2016       | 25 → 12.5          |
| 3rd     | 2020       | 12.5 → 6.25        |
| 4th     | April 2024 | 6.25 → 3.125       |

## Lightning Network (Layer 2) – 2025 Status

- **Purpose**: Off-chain transactions to reduce network load
- **Channel capacity (2025)**: **5,300+ BTC**
- **Enterprise adoption**:
  - **Steak ’n Shake** (US restaurant chain)
  - Transaction fees cut by up to 50%
- **Benefits**:
  - Instant transfers
  - Near-zero fees
  - Reduces congestion on the base layer

## Taproot and BIP Upgrades

- **Taproot** (activated: 2021):
  - Introduced BIP 340, 341, 342
  - **Schnorr signatures** → efficient, higher privacy
  - Makes multisig transactions appear simpler
- **Benefits**:
  - Increased privacy
  - Smart contract readiness
  - Foundation for further optimization

## El Salvador and Bitcoin (Updated 2025)

- **2021**: First country to declare Bitcoin legal tender
- **January 2025**: New law enacted:
  - Bitcoin remains **legal tender**
  - But acceptance by merchants becomes **optional** (due to IMF deal)
- **IMF Agreement**: $1.2B aid contingent on legal reform
- **Ground Reality**:
  - 80% of citizens don’t use the Chivo wallet
  - Government holds ~$760M in Bitcoin reserves

---

## Criticisms and Risks

- **Energy usage**: Consumes more electricity than countries like Norway (~173 TWh/year)
- **Criminal activity**: Darknet, ransomware, anonymous transfers
- **Price volatility**: Sudden crashes and surges
- **Environmental concerns**: Traditional PoW leaves high carbon footprint

## Conclusion

Satoshi Nakamoto’s identity remains unknown, but the idea he introduced changed the world.  
Bitcoin is no longer just a digital currency — it is a symbol of economic freedom, decentralization, and technological disruption.
