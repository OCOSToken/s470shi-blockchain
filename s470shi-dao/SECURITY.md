## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Responsible disclosure saves the community. Please follow the steps below if you discover a vulnerability:**

1. **Private Reporting:**  
   - DO NOT report vulnerabilities or exploits via GitHub issues, pull requests, or public chat.
   - Instead, email us directly at:  
     **security@ocos.io**  
     Or (backup): **admin@ocos.io**
2. **Include in your report:**  
   - Detailed description of the issue.
   - Steps to reproduce (code, payload, environment).
   - Impact assessment (what can be affected/exploited).
   - Suggested fixes, if any.
   - Optional: Your GitHub username or ETH address for possible acknowledgment or reward.

3. **Response Timeline:**  
   - You will receive an initial acknowledgment within **72 hours**.
   - We will coordinate to validate, patch, and publicly disclose (see below) the vulnerability.

4. **Public Disclosure:**  
   - Vulnerabilities will be disclosed responsibly after a patch is released.
   - Security advisories and credits will be published in the [Security Advisories](../../security/advisories) section.

## Vulnerability Handling Workflow

1. **Report submitted** to security contacts.
2. **Triage and verification** by the S470SHI DAO core team and/or external auditors.
3. **Patch developed** (in private fork or security branch).
4. **Release coordinated** (mainnet/testnet/hard fork if needed).
5. **Public disclosure** with full details and credit to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).
6. **Post-mortem** and incident review published for transparency and learning.

## Security Best Practices for Users & Contributors

- Always use the latest official release.
- Do **not** share private keys, seed phrases, or sensitive data in any public forum or codebase.
- Review smart contracts and dependencies before deployment.
- For contributors:  
  - Test new code in isolated environments before PRs.
  - Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys (use `.env` and respect `.gitignore`).
- Enable 2FA on all relevant accounts (GitHub, wallets, etc).
- Watch for phishing and fake websites mimicking s470shi.org or DAO platforms.

## Threat Model

- **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities:**  
  - Reentrancy, overflow/underflow, frontrunning, logic bugs, improper access control, governance bypass, etc.
- **Protocol Risks:**  
  - Sybil attacks, voting manipulation, oracle attacks, economic exploits, etc.
- **Social Engineering:**  
  - Phishing, impersonation, Discord/Telegram/Forum social exploits.
- **Operational:**  
  - Node compromise, RPC endpoint attacks, DDoS.

**We encourage responsible testing, audits, and peer review.**

## Bug Bounty

If you responsibly disclose a critical bug or vulnerability, you may be eligible for a reward.  
All bounties are at the discretion of the DAO governance.  
Rewards may be paid in S47 tokens or other agreed means.

**For eligibility:**
- The bug must not be already known/publicly disclosed.
- Only the first reporter of an issue is eligible for reward.
- All communication regarding the bug must be private until a fix is deployed.

---

## Security Audits

- All smart contracts, governance modules, and critical code are open to third-party audits.
- Major releases and upgrades should be audited before mainnet deployment.
- Community-driven audit initiatives are welcomed and credited.

**Recommended audit partners:**  
CertiK, Trail of Bits, OpenZeppelin, community auditors.

---

## Incident Disclosure

- All significant incidents and vulnerabilities will be disclosed in full detail in the [Security Advisories](../../security/advisories).
- Incident post-mortems and response reviews will be made available for transparency.
