# S470SHI DAO — Fixed Price & Universal Voting Protocol for S47 and OCOS Tokens

---

## **1. Introduction**

This document defines the core governance and economic protocol for the S470SHI DAO:  
Every S47 and OCOS token is **pegged at a fixed value of 47 USD**, and holders of either token have equal voting rights within the DAO.

---

## **2. Fixed Price Mechanism**

- **Price definition:**
    - **1 S47 = 1 OCOS = 47 USD** (fixed)
    - This price is hard-coded into DAO smart contracts and all official DAO platforms.
    - Both S47 and OCOS prices are tracked and maintained via Oracles or on-chain price feeds.
    - Price stability is ensured through a DAO treasury-backed reserve and/or stabilization fund.

---

## **3. Token Equality & Voting Rights**

- **Universal Voting Power:**
    - Any DAO member holding S47 and/or OCOS tokens has full voting rights.
- **Equality principle:**
    - 1 S47 = 1 OCOS = 1 vote.
    - Both balances can be used together for voting.
- **Voting power:**
    - A user's voting power = S47 balance + OCOS balance.

---

## **4. Voting Protocol & Smart Contract Mechanics**

- **Participation:**
    - DAO members can submit and/or vote on governance proposals.
    - Voting rights are determined by both S47 and OCOS balances.
- **Smart Contract Pseudocode:**
    ```solidity
    mapping(address => uint256) public s47Balance;
    mapping(address => uint256) public ocosBalance;

    function votingPower(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
        return s47Balance[user] + ocosBalance[user];
    }

    function vote(uint256 proposalId, uint256 amount) public {
        require(votingPower(msg.sender) >= amount, "Insufficient voting tokens");
        // Voting logic implementation goes here
    }
    ```
- **Frontend and explorer:**
    - Each user's S47 and OCOS balances are displayed together.
    - Both tokens are combined as voting power during all proposals.

---

## **5. Price Stability & Audit**

- **Oracle and price feed:**  
    The DAO continuously monitors the USD value of S47 and OCOS via oracle or price feed modules.
- **Stabilization reserve:**  
    If the peg deviates, the DAO enacts automatic rebalancing or liquidity measures.
- **Open audit:**  
    For every governance cycle, price stability and the stabilization reserve are reported and made public.

---

## **6. DAO Governance & Public Transparency**

- **All voting and price stability mechanisms are on-chain, transparent, and fully auditable.**
- **Every DAO member—whether holding S47 or OCOS—has equal rights in decision-making.**
- **The protocol for price and voting can only be changed via DAO voting and supermajority approval.**

---

## **7. Manifesto & Principle**

> **“S47 and OCOS are the symbols of equality, stability, and collective will.  
> The fixed price of 47 USD grants universal value and decision-making power to every DAO participant.”**

---

## **Additional**

- **Changes to this protocol are only possible by DAO voting and supermajority consensus.**
