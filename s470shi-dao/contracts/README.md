# S470SHI DAO Smart Contracts

This folder contains the core smart contracts for the S470SHI DAO ecosystem, designed for maximum security, modularity, and on-chain governance.

---

## Contracts Overview

### 1. S47Token.sol

- **Type:** ERC20 Governance & Legacy Token
- **Purpose:**  
  Represents voting and legacy power in the DAO. All major DAO decisions and legacy claims are powered by the S47 token.
- **Features:**  
  - Fully audit-friendly ERC20 implementation (OpenZeppelin standard)
  - `mint`, `burn`, and `pause` functionalities (governed by DAO/multisig)
  - Ownership transfer for evolving governance
  - 47,000,000 initial supply (18 decimals), all minted to DAO treasury

### 2. S470SHIDAO.sol

- **Type:** Universal DAO Governance Contract
- **Purpose:**  
  Enables on-chain governance, proposal management, voting, and treasury/legacy actions for both S47 and OCOS token holders.
- **Features:**  
  - Proposal creation (any S47/OCOS holder)
  - On-chain voting: S47 + OCOS balances = voting power
  - Quorum enforcement and 75% supermajority for treasury/legacy actions
  - Modular structure for adding treasury, airdrop, legacy, or audit logic
  - All proposals, votes, and results are fully transparent and auditable

## Usage Flow

1. **S47/OCOS token holders** can submit proposals and vote via the DAO interface.
2. **Voting power** is calculated as the sum of S47 and OCOS balances.
3. **Quorum and supermajority** rules ensure robust decentralized governance.
4. **Treasury actions, legacy claims, and upgrades** require strict proposal/voting flows.

---

## Security & Audit

- All contracts are built with OpenZeppelin and audited patterns.
- Governance is enforced on-chain; only proposals that pass quorum and supermajority can trigger critical actions.
- All voting, proposals, and treasury movements are transparent and permanently recorded on-chain.

---

## Extensibility

These contracts are designed to be easily extended with modules for:
- Airdrops & rewards
- Snapshot voting
- Legacy wallet management
- On-chain audit trails
- Future DAO features
