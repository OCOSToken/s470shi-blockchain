## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Responsible disclosure is essential for the security and sustainability of open-source projects.**

If you discover a security vulnerability or a critical bug in the S470SHI Hybrid Blockchain Language project:

2. Instead, please report it **privately** by emailing us at:

   - **security@ocos.io**  
   - Or directly to the maintainers: admin@ocos.io

3. Include the following details in your report (if possible):
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue (if applicable)
   - The impact and possible exploit scenario
   - Any suggestions for mitigation or fix

We aim to acknowledge receipt of your report within **72 hours** and will coordinate a fix or mitigation as soon as possible.
