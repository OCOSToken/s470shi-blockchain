## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take protocol security extremely seriously.  
**If you discover a vulnerability, DO NOT disclose it publicly or via issues/PRs.**

**Responsible Disclosure:**  
- Please email **security@s470shi.org** with the following details:
  - Clear vulnerability description
  - Impact and risk assessment
  - Step-by-step reproduction
  - (Optional) Suggested remediation/fix

We will respond within **72 hours** and coordinate a fix and public disclosure.

---

## Coordinated Disclosure & Bug Bounty

- Critical and high-risk bugs may be eligible for bug bounties.
- All contributors will be credited (with permission).
- Coordinated security advisories will be published on [s470shi.org](https://s470shi.org) and official channels.

---

## Secure Development & Review

- All core smart contracts are subject to **independent 3rd-party audit** before mainnet deployment.
- All bug fixes, dependency updates, and pull requests must pass mandatory code review and test suite.
- Automated CI/CD runs security, static analysis, and test coverage for every commit.

---

## Best Practices for Deployers

- Never deploy to production with unaudited or modified contracts.
- Use **multi-signature wallets** for admin/DAO actions.
- Always verify contract source code on explorers.
- Store all sensitive keys (private, API, multisig) in secure vaults (never in plain text or repo).
- Monitor all contract addresses and admin actions with real-time alerting.

---

## Exploit & Incident Response

In the event of a confirmed exploit:
- Immediate public notification will be issued.
- Emergency pause/guard modules will be activated (if available).
- A full post-mortem and on-chain incident report will be published.
- DAO community will be notified via s470shi.org and social media.

---

## No Warranty

All code is provided **AS IS**. Users and deployers assume all risks.  
For critical deployments, always use independently audited code, follow secure deployment, and remain vigilant to new threats.
